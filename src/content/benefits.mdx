# GoGo Groundhog Genesis Collection Utility

<br />

When the founders started this project, we wanted to make sure we were offering something to our community that hasn't been seen a thousand times before. And we think we've more than accomplished that!

<div className="feature-set">

All Genesis Collection GoGo Groundhog holders will receive 30% (APR) USD value interest, year to date, on their Groundhog NFTs - from the original mint price - **0.035ETH**.

This means, if you spend **$1000** on Genesis GoGo Groundhogs, you will get back **$300** - for as long as you have them!

This interest will be paid out in the form of **DAI** - a stablecoin that maintains the value of the United States dollar.

**30%** is way more than you get at almost any bank!

This APR interest payment will follow the Groundhogs wherever they may go - always connected to whatever wallet the NFT is in. So, if you purchase a Groundhog retail, win one in a giveaway, use one for a giveaway, trade for a Groundhog, or just decide to give one to a friend - whoever has the Groundhog NFTs in their wallets will receive the **30%** annual interest income.

This is amazing REAL LIFE passive income just for owning Groundhogs that truly sets us apart in the NFT world! What else in the world gives you **30%** APR just for owning assets in your wallet?!

**But why stop there?**

In addition to our 30% APR interest utility, the Genesis GoGo Groundhogs Collection is headed into the Metaverse with Genesis GoGo Groundhog babies!

For every Genesis GoGo Groundhog asset you have in your wallet, you will be issued a female GoGo Groundhog that will allow you to breed your assets and make new lil' Groundhog babies.

Each Genesis Groundhog NFT in your wallet will earn you 100 tokens (official token name TBD) per month. The price to breed your Groundhogs will be 1,000 tokens.

Users will have the ability to offer tokens on any Defi Exchange

Your baby Genesis Groundhogs will take 7 days to appear in your wallet after breeding

A DAO will be set up for Groundhog holders to allow the community to weigh in on future decisions regarding breeding, additional collections, etc.

Genesis GoGo Groundhogs is heading into the metaverse with GoGo Groundhog Voxels - where you can put your breeding to use and fun!

This utility is what's going to take the Genesis GoGo Groundhogs Collection to the moon!!!
